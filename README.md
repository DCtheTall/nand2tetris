# Nand2Tetris projects

This repository contains working code for the projects for [Nand2Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome), a computer architecture MOOC on Coursera.

## Projects

### 1. Logic gates

`projects/01` contains [HDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language) implementations of several Boolean logic gates.

### 2. Adder

`projects/02` contains an HDL implementation of a logic gates that add or increment integers.

### 3. RAM and program counter

`projects/03/a/` contains an HDL implementation of a program counter and 64 bits of RAM.

`projects/03/b/` contains HDL implementations of various sizes of RAM.

### 4. Hack assembly

`projects/04/fill` contains Hack assembly code which toggles the color of the screen of the Hack computer when a key is pressed.

`projects/04/mult` contains Hack assembly code which multiplies two integers.

### 5. Hack computer and CPU

`projects/05/` contains HDL implementations of a Hack computer and its CPU.

### 6. Hack assembler

`projects/06/` contains a Python implementation of a Hack assembler, `HackAssembler.py` that translates Hack assembly code into binary machine instructions.

### 7. VM translator I

`projects/07/` contains a _partial_ Python implementation of a Jack VM translator, `VMTranslator.py`, which translates Jack VM code into Hack assembly.

### 8. VM translatoer II

`projects/08/` contains a _complete_ Python implementation of a Jack VM translator, `VMTranslator.py`, which translates Jack VM code into Hack assembly.

### 9. Tetris in Jack

`projects/09/Tetris/` contains a Jack implementation of the game Tetris.

### 10. Jack compilter I

`projects/10/` contains a Python implementation of a Jack analyzer, `JackAnalyzer.py`, which parses Jack code and outputs the abstract syntax tree as XML.

### 11. Jack compilter II

`projects/11/` contains a Python implementation of a Jack compiler, `JackCompiler.py`, which compiles Jack code into VM instructions.

### 12. Jack OS API

`projects/12/` contains Jack implementations of the classes provided by the Jack OS API.
